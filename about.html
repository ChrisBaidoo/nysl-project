          <h2>Mission</h2>

          <p>
            To support young athletes living in Chicago’s northside
            neighbourhoods, who have an interest in learning and playing
            soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related
            to the game of soccer, specifically those skills around team
            cooperation and good sportsmanship.
          </p>

          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>
            The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
            well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of
            character, self discipline and leadership.
          </p>

          <h2>General Information</h2>

          <p>
            The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to
            provide athletes residing in Chicago’s northside neighbourhoods
            an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member
            of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12 and resides in
            Chicago northside neighbourhood. NYSL is ran by small full-time
            staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and
            previous league members.
