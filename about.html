            <h2>Mission</h2>

            <p>
              To support young athletes living in Chicago’s northside
              neighbourhoods, who have an interest in learning and playing
              soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to
              the game of soccer, specifically those skills around team
              cooperation and good sportsmanship.
            </p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
              The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
              well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of
              character, self discipline and leadership.
            </p>

            <h2>General Information</h2>

            <p>
              The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to
              provide athletes residing in Chicago’s northside neighbourhoods an
              environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of
              NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12 and resides in Chicago
              northside neighbourhood. NYSL is ran by small full-time staff, and
              relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous
              league members.
